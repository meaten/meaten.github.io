This paper reviews the NTIRE2021 challenge on burst
super-resolution. Given a RAW noisy burst as input, the
task in the challenge was to generate a clean RGB image
with 4 times higher resolution. The challenge contained two
tracks; Track 1 evaluating on synthetically generated data,
and Track 2 using real-world bursts from mobile camera.
In the final testing phase, 6 teams submitted results using a
diverse set of solutions. The top-performing methods set a
new state-of-the-art for the burst super-resolution task.
