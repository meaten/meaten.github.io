This paper proposes a framework for automatically
annotating the keypoints of a human body in images
for learning 2D pose estimation models. While considerable contributions in the community provide us
a huge number of pose-annotated images, all of them
mainly focus on people wearing common clothes, which
are relatively easy to annotate the body keypoints. This
paper, on the other hand, focuses on annotating people wearing loose-fitting clothes that occlude many body
keypoints. In order to automatically and correctly annotate these people, we divert the 3D coordinates of the
keypoints observed without loose-fitting clothes, which
can be captured by a motion capture system (MoCap).
These 3D keypoints are projected to an image where
the body pose under loose-fitting clothes is similar to
the one captured by the MoCap. Pose similarity between bodies with and without loose-fitting clothes is
evaluated with 3D geometric configurations of MoCap
markers that are visible even with loose-fitting clothes.
Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our
proposed framework for human pose estimation.
