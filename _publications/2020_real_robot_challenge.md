This report describes our winning submission to the Real Robot Challenge. The Real Robot Challenge
is a three-phase dexterous manipulation competition that involves manipulating various rectangular
objects with the TriFinger Platform. Our approach combines motion planning with several motion
primitives to manipulate the object. For Phases 1 and 2, we additionally learn a residual policy in
simulation that applies corrective actions on top of our controller. Our approach won first place in
Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the competition. We were anonymously known as ‘ardentstork’ on the competition
leaderboard. Videos and our code can be found at https://github.com/ripl-ttic/real-robot-challenge.
